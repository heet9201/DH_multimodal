    "text": "The term bandhani is derived from the Sanskrit verbal root bandh (to bind, to tie). Today most Bandhani making centres are situated in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Sindh, Punjab region, and in Tamil Nadu where it's known as Sungudi.\n\nEarliest evidence of Bandhani dates back to the Indus Valley Civilization where dyeing was done as early as 4000 B.C. The earliest example of the most pervasive type of Bandhani dots can be seen in the 6th century paintings depicting the life of Buddha found on the wall of Cave 1 at Ajanta.\n\nBandhani is believed to have originated from the city of Ajrakhpur in Gujarat in the 6th century BC. The name Bandhani is derived from the Sanskrit word bandhana, which means to bind. The technique of tie-dye fabrics is believed to have been brought to India by Persian traders who traveled along the Silk Roads.\n\nThis art finds its mention in Alexander the great time texts about the beautiful printed cottons of India. As per evidence in Historical Texts, the first Bandhani saree was worn at the time of Bana Bhatt's Harshacharita in a royal marriage.\n\nIt was believed that wearing a Bandhani saree can bring a good future to a bride. Ajanta walls stand for the evidence of these Bandhani sarees. It is also known as Bandhej and Pilia."

His mother and grandmother taught him the intricate process of tying and binding traditional patterns, while his father educated him in the art of dyeing. Aziz expanded his skills beyond his family's teachings. He received a scholarship from the All India Handicrafts Board to study natural dyeing and later trained at the Ahmedabad Textile Industries Research Association. Aziz has innovated traditional Bandhani techniques to create new patterns, and he has incorporated stitched and clamped shibori, a Japanese resist-dyeing technique, into his work."

They were mentored by their uncles and cousins who were still in the trade. Their family is known for tying extremely fine dot patterns in a sophisticated composition style. Jabbar and his brothers have continued in this vein, with their mother, sister, and over two hundred women from their community tying the fine patterns that merge traditional and contemporary designs."
